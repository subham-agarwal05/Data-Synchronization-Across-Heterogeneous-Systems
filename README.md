# Data Synchronization Across Heterogeneous Systems

This project addresses the challenge of synchronizing data across diverse systems that may differ in platforms, data formats, and communication protocols. It provides a solution to ensure data consistency and integrity across such heterogeneous environments.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Version Control:** Git

## 📄 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or higher
* Database servers (e.g., Hive, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) installed and running

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subham-agarwal05/Data-Synchronization-Across-Heterogeneous-Systems.git
   cd Data-Synchronization-Across-Heterogeneous-Systems
   ```



2. **Build the project using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```



### Database Configuration

Before running the application, ensure that all required database servers are up and running. Then, configure the database connection details in the respective DAO (Data Access Object) files:

1. **Start Database Servers:**

   * Ensure that all necessary database servers (e.g., Hive, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are installed and running on your system.

2. **Configure DAO Files:**

   * Navigate to the `src` directory and locate the DAO classes responsible for database interactions.

   * For each DAO class, update the database connection parameters (such as database name, username, and password) to match your local database setup.

   * Example (for a Hive DAO):([GitHub][1])

     ```java
        private static final String URL = "jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default";
        private static final String USER = "hive";
        private static final String PASSWORD = "";
     ```

   * Repeat this process for each DAO class corresponding to different databases.

## 🚀 Usage

After configuring the DAO files and building the project, you can run the application by executing the `Main.java` file located in the `src` directory.
